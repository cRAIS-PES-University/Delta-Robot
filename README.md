# Delta-Robot
A Delta robot is a type of parallel robot characterized by its unique design, consisting of three
lightweight arms connected to a common base. Each arm operates using parallelograms to
maintain the orientation of the end effector, enabling high-speed and high-precision movements.
Its architecture allows it to excel in tasks requiring rapid pick-and-place actions. The movement of
the end effector is typically limited to three translational degrees of freedom (x, y, z), though
rotational capabilities can be added in advanced models. The project is to build a Delta Robot and
create a reference application.
